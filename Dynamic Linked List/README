This program builds a list of pointer-linked node classes that each contain values specified by the user. Each time the user enters a number,
a new node is created to store that number and then linked to the existing list object via pointer in non contiguous memory. Then the list is recursively sorted via
selection sort or merge sort algorithms. Prime numbers are also detected and displayed at the end.
